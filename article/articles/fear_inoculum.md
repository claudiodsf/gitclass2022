It is the band's first album in 13 years, due to creative, personal, and legal issues band members encountered since the release of 10,000 Days.

It was released to critical acclaim, with reviewers generally agreeing that the band had successfully refined their established sound.

The album topped the US Billboard 200 chart, their third in a row to do so, selling over 270,000 album-equivalent units. The album topped five other national album charts in its opening week as well.

Two songs off the album received Grammy nominations, the first single "Fear Inoculum", for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song, and "7empest", for the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance, with the latter winning the award.
